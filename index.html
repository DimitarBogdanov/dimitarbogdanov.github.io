					<p>
						Hi, I'm <a href="https://pronouncenames.com/search?name=Dimitar" target="_blank">Dimitar</a>, I am a 15 year-old guy studying applied programming in Bulgaria. I started tinkering around with computers at the age of about 6-7, and wrote my first line of code at the age of 8 (albeit it was just "Close" in VB.NET for a button, I was - and still am - quite proud to have done that without any kind of help!)
					</p>
					<p>
						Ever since, computers have been my top-specialty. I can code in a couple of languages, and have made lots of projects with each.

					<h2 class="noselect"><i class="fas fa-caret-square-right"></i> Programming</h2>
					<p>
						I specialise in C# and LuaU. I can also write code in Java, JavaScript, and regular Lua. Most of my experience stems from toying around with writing WinForms apps, writing many websites as a kid, a couple of attempts at writing a compiler, making numerous games with ROBLOX, and playing around with Unity.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also played around with the Minecraft mod "ComputerCraft", which introduces programmable computers (in Lua) to the game.
